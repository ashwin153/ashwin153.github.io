# Introduction
The case for Twitter requires many more than 140 characters. Amid recent concerns about the financial viability of the company, investors and analysts have been flocking away from Twitter in droves. When they look at the quantitative and qualitative evidence, they see a company in distress. But what if they're just looking at the wrong evidence? 

The best place to begin analyzing a company is its perceived failings. When people cite Twitter's failings, they typically discuss its stagnant user growth, poor revenue growth, mediocre product changes, and rampant abuse. In the upcoming sections, I will individually analyze each of these perceived failings and discuss why I am still optimistic about the future of the company.

# Failure \#1: Stagnant User Growth
<a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/2883/twitters-user-growth/" title="Infographic: Twitter Fails to Reignite User Growth | Statista"><img src="https://d28wbuch0jlv7v.cloudfront.net/images/infografik/normal/chartoftheday_2883_Twitters_user_growth_n.jpg" alt="Infographic: Twitter Fails to Reignite User Growth | Statista" style="width: 100%; height: auto !important; max-width:960px;-ms-interpolation-mode: bicubic;"/></a><br />

It's obvious from the graph above that user growth has plunged in recent quarters. Twitter does have a real problem attracting people to its platform and encouraging them to share their thoughts and opinions freely. However, unlike other social networks user growth is an unfair metric for measuring the success of Twitter's platform. According to an article by [Slate Magazine](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2014/05/twitter_is_not_dying_it_s_on_the_cusp_of_getting_much_bigger.html): 

<blockquote>
Here’s what Wall Street needs to understand: Since Facebook is made up of a huge number of roughly equivalent individual users, its volume of “monthly active users” is a reasonable way to measure its growth and scope. Twitter comprises a relatively small number of public figures broadcasting their messages publicly and a somewhat larger direct audience. That makes “monthly active users” a crude metric at best, since one group of users is very different from the other.
</blockquote>

If monthly active users and user growth are "crude metrics", then how do we go about measuring the success of Twitter? Before answering that question, it's first important to understand why people use Twitter. According to a comparative study of social media preferences summarized in the chart below, millenials prefer Twitter over Facebook when looking for real-time trending content and news coverage.

<a href="http://www.statista.com/statistics/417925/us-millennials-facebook-twitter-reasons/"><img src="http://www.statista.com/graphic/1/417925/us-millennials-facebook-twitter-reasons.jpg" alt="Statistic: Most common reasons for Millennials in the United States to use Facebook and Twitter as of February 2015 | Statista" style="width: 100%; height: auto !important; max-width:1000px;-ms-interpolation-mode: bicubic;"/></a>

This focus on real-time communication is also supported by Twiter's own [annual report](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000156459016013646/twtr-10k_20151231.htm), which claims that Twitter is in the business of "creating and sharing ideas and information without barriers." Clearly, the success of the company should be measured by its ability to encourage real-time commentary and conversations on its website. The ability to encourage *impactful* conversation can be easily approximated with a tweets per user metric. However, some users are able to have significantly more impactful conversations on Twitter simply because they have more followers. Therefore, a better metric for estimating Twitter's ability to generate meaning social interactions is *follower-weighted* tweets per user.

- Insert statistical analysis of follower-weighted tweets per user
	- Random sample of tweets
	- Avoid selection bias (time, user, topic, etc.)
	- Contrast follower-weighted tweets per user with tweets per user
		- How do the two metrics differ?
		- Do they have similar trends?

# Failure \#2: Poor Revenue Growth
Crisis of expectation, not of product.

The biggest reason why Twitter is here to stay is **data licensing**. Twitter does not need to monetize its user base, it needs to monetize the *activity* of its user base. Twitter has always had a massive repository of tweets and sold access to its "firehose" tweet stream (500m tweets/day), but people have only recently started to figure out how to use its data.

- Insert analysis of data licensing segment
	- Show graphs of increasing revenues
	- Show graphs of increasing customers
- Insert analysis of companies that use Twitter data
	- DataSift
	- Brandwatch
	- Jive
	- Selerity
	- Dataminr
- Stress how Twitter data has varied uses in a range of industries
- Stress how Twitter data represents unadulterated commentary and conversations
	- People post what is on their mind, not what they think people want to see
- Ways for Twitter to improve data licensing
	- Make it easier to consume the data
		- Extract out features
		- Make it easier to conduct statistical analysis
	- Make it more accessible
		- Cheaper price point encourages innovation
		- Streamline application process

# Failure \#3: Mediocre Product Changes

# Failure \#4: Rampant Abuse

What should worry Twitter isn't the value of its stock, but *irrelevance*. Twitter has enough cash to sustain operations for another four-hundred and twelve years, but preferences have shifted to other social media platforms like Snapchat, Instagram, and WeChat.

http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2014/05/twitter_is_not_dying_it_s_on_the_cusp_of_getting_much_bigger.html
Twitter is not a social network, it's a media platform.

http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/11/05/heres-how-twitter-is-boosting-its-revenue.aspx
Twitter seems to be reaching the saturation point for advertisements per timeline view and its timeline views per user are falling. While the advertisement division has been growing consistently, it is quickly approaching maximum size. Twitter does not need to monetize its user base, it needs to monetize the *activity* of its user base. Part of the reason why companies are hesitant to license Twitter data is because they don't know how to effectively use it. Twitter needs to package its data better from consumption. It needs to make it easier to extract meaningful features from its vast datasets.
