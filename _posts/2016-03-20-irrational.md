# The Brain is Irrational
Consider a situation in which a thirsty husband is furious that his wife has once again finished all of their milk. When the situation is examined in isolation, the husband's anger seems irrational. It's just a carton of milk! When the situation is viewed in the broader scope of their relationship; however, the husband's anger might seem more justified. Maybe he has told her on numerous occasions to replace the empty carton in the refrigerator. This situation illustrates a larger point: our ability to rationalize our emotions increases as we broaden the scope of our investigation. Therefore, the only way to fully rationalize our emotions is to view them in the broadest possible context which is the set of all relevant previous actions taken by every individual. Because our brain has finite capacity and its choice of measure of relevance is arbitrary, **we must accept that our actions will always have some degree of unexplainable irrationality.**

# The Irrational Neural Network
There is no better machine learning algorithm than the human brain. We can think of the brain as a neural network whose inputs are present sensory readings (sight, smell, etc.) and the actions taken after similar past sensory readings (memories) and whose output is the action taken in the present. The human brain has finite capacity, so it chooses to retain memories based on temporal proximity and potential for future use. In summary, we can digitally mimic the irrational human brain by constructing a neural network whose outputs are informed by its current inputs and its memory of its outputs during similar past input conditions. The irrationality of this neural network stems from its finite memory capacity and its arbitrary choice of measure of input similarity.
