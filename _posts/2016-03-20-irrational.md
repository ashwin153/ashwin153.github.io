Consider a situation in which a thirsty husband is furious that his wife has once again finished all of their milk. When the situation is examined in isolation, the husband's anger seems irrational. It's just a carton of milk! When the situation is viewed in the broader scope of their relationship; however, the husband's anger might seem more justified. Maybe he has told her on numerous occasions to replace the empty carton in the refrigerator. This situation illustrates a larger point: our ability to rationalize our emotions increases as we broaden the scope of our investigation. Therefore, the only way to fully rationalize our emotions is to view them in the broadest possible context, which is the set of all previous actions taken by every individual. Because this set is infinite and our brain has finite capacity, **we must accept that our actions will always have some degree of unexplainable irrationality.**

There is no better machine learning algorithm than the human brain. The brain can be thought of as a feed-forward neural network whose inputs are past (memory) and present (sight, smell, etc.) sensory readings and whose outputs are actions taken in the present. Because the brain has finite memory capacity, it must decide which memories to retain based on temporal proximity and potential for future use. This arbitrary criteria for memory retention is the source of the irrationality of our actions. It would be an interesting intellectual exercise, to codify these properties into an "Irrational Neural Network" and test its performance against conventional approaches.
