I'm often asked about the value in studying pure mathematics. I'll admit that the study of topological spaces and abstract algebraic structures may seem at first glance to be a pointless theoretical exercise. However, the real value of pure mathematics lies not in its practical applications, which - while not obvious - are countless, but in the problem solving techniques and the logical argumentation it forces its students to learn. A rigorous study of any branch of pure mathematics begins with a set of simple axioms that describe the behavior of some mathematical object and builds up a set of interesting properties of this mathematical object that follow as logical consequences of these simple axioms. This process of proving complicated properties of mathematical objects using simpler properties and basic axioms teaches you to **repose new problems is terms of previous results.** The ability to reframe a problem into a familiar context is an invaluable skill for understanding new ideas both in pure mathematics and in the real world.
