# Project 1: Circle Detection
In this assignment, we developed an algorithm that uses Hough Transforms to detect circles of arbitrary radii within arbitrary images.

## What is a Hough Transform?
A Hough Transform utilizes a voting procedure at image edge points to identify shapes. Each edge point *votes* for shape parameters and the parameters that *accumulate* the most votes represent identified shapes.

For example, Hough Transforms were first used to locate lines within an image. The first step is to locate image edge points. In the example below, I used the Canny Edge Detector built into MATLAB. Each edge point then votes for all lines that pass through it. Lines that receive more votes must pass through more edge points. In the example below, the solid line in the third image passes through a large number of edge points, so it is likely to be identified as a line.

<img align="center" style="float: right; width: 33.25%" src="/img/cv-d11.png"/>
<div style="clear: both;"/>
</div>

This procedure can be generalized to arbitrary shapes. We will use Generalized Hough Transforms to vote for circles. Instead of voting for line parameters (r and theta), we will vote for circle parameters (radius and center).

## Fixed-Radius Circle Detection
Let's first build an algorithm capable of detecting circles of a *fixed* radius $$r$$, and then generalize it to detecting circles of arbitrary radii. We still locate image edge points using the Canny Edge Detector; however, each edge point now votes for circles centered r pixels away in every direction.

<img align="center" style="float: left;  width: 33.25%" src="/img/cv-d13.png"/>
<img align="center" style="float: left;  width: 33.25%" src="/img/cv-d14.png"/>
<img align="center" style="float: right; width: 33.25%" src="/img/cv-d15.png"/>
<div style="clear: both;"/>
</div>

A simple optimization is to have edge points *only* vote for circles in the direction in and opposite the edge image gradient. This optimization technique is illustrated in the figure above. The images below depict the Hough Space Accumulator, or the number of votes for various circle parameters. The images on the right use the gradient of edge image optimization technique and the images on the left do not.

<img align="center" style="float: right; width: 49%"  src="/img/cv-d8.png">
<div style="clear: both;"/>
</div>

We now have a simple, yet remarkably effective way of detecting fixed-radius circles within images. The following images illustrate results for various images and various radii.

</div>

## Arbitrary Radii Circle Detection
In order to generalize our fixed-radii circle detector to arbitrary radii, we simply need to add another dimension to our Hough Space. Edge points still vote for centers that are r pixels away; however, r is no longer a fixed parameter and can take values on $$1 < r < size(img) / 2$$.  

<img align="center" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block;" src="/img/cv-d9.png">

{% highlight matlab linenos %}
function [ circles ] = detect_arbitrary_circles( im )

%   circles = detectArbitraryCircles(im); circles is [cx, cy, radius]

    % Calculate the edge image; extract all the indicies of edges 
    binary = edge(rgb2gray(im), 'canny');
    [y, x] = find(binary > 0); 
    [~, Gdir] = imgradient(binary);

    % Our hough space is a 3-D space in which each element represents the 
    % number of votes for a circle of center (x, y) and some radius
    height = size(binary, 1); 
    width  = size(binary, 2); 
    hough = zeros(width, height, uint32(min(height, width) ./ 2));
         
    % For each edge point and for each possible radius, vote on centers
    for i = 1:length(x)
        for radius = 1:size(hough, 3)
            % Use the image gradient to reduce the number of votes
            grad = Gdir(y(i), x(i)) * pi/180;
            for theta = [grad pi+grad]
                % Calculate the center point to vote for. Take the current
                % point and add/subtract some dx/dy to it
                cx = uint32(x(i) + radius * cos(theta));
                cy = uint32(y(i) - radius * sin(theta));

                if(cx >= 1 && cx <= size(hough, 1) && cy >= 1 && cy <= size(hough, 2)) 
                    hough(cx, cy, radius) = hough(cx, cy, radius) + 1;
                end 
            end 
        end 
    end

    smooth = convn(hough, fspecial('gaussian'), 'same');
    maxima = smooth .* imregionalmax(smooth, 26);
    vector = nonzeros(reshape(maxima, numel(maxima) , 1));
    [cx, cy, r] = ind2sub(size(hough), find(maxima > max(vector) .* 0.60));
    circles = horzcat(cx, cy, r); 
end

# Project 2: Content-Aware Resizing
When the aspect ratio of an image changes during resizing, image content is left distorted and stretched. The goal of [content-aware resizing](http://perso.crans.org/frenoy/matlab2012/seamcarving.pdf) is to consider *image content* when resizing in order to change the aspect ratio while preserving the integrity of image content. The images below illustrate the benefits of a content-aware resize. The left picture depicts the original image. Unlike the normal resize in the middle, the content-aware resize on the right is able to preserve the lady's facial features by removing the unimportant white space in the background.

<img align="center" style="float: right; width: 33.25%" src="/img/cv-a9.png"/>
<div style="clear: both;"/>
</div>

## Overview
Content-aware resizing utilizes a procedure known as _seam carving_ to locate and remove unimportant paths through an image. One method of measuring the "importance" of a path is using the cumulative gradient magnitude, or the sum of image gradients at each pixel in the path. Because high image gradients typically occur along object boundaries, paths with low cumulative gradient magnitudes most likely avoid critical foreground objects.

Seams are 8-connected paths of pixels; vertical seams cross the image from top to bottom and horizontal seams cross the image from left to right. The right-most image in the figure above depicts vertical and horizontal seams that minimize the cumulative gradient magnitude in each direction. How do you locate these optimal seams?

### Naive Optimization
The simplest solution would be to first sum the gradient magnitudes for every pixel in each path, and then select the path with the minimal cumulative gradient magnitude. However, for an $$n$$ by $$m$$ image there are approximately $$m * 3 ^ n$$ possible vertical seams and $$n * 3 ^ m$$ possible horizontal seams. This naive approach would be okay for very small images, but it scales poorly with the size of the image. For example, there are approximately $$590,490$$ different vertical and horizontal seams for a $$10$$ by $$10$$ image!

### Dynamic Programming
A far better solution uses dynamic programming to significantly improve the complexity of the algorithm. The intuition behind the approach is that _an optimal path is itself composed of optimal paths_. In other words, if a path A-B-C is optimal, then the paths A-B and B-C must themselves be optimal. Therefore, we can construct an optimal seam through an image by concatenating optimal paths between pixels. This intuition leads us to two fairly simple mathematical formulas. 

Let $$E(i, j)$$ be the gradient magnitude, $$V(i, j)$$ be the vertical cumulative gradient magnitude and $$H(i, j)$$ be the horizontal cumulative gradient magnitude at some pixel $$i, j$$ within an image. 

$$V(i, j) = E(i, j) + min(V(i-1, j-1), V(i-1, j), V(i-1, j+1))$$
$$H(i, j) = E(i, j) + min(H(i-1, j-1), H(i, j-1), H(i+1, j-1))$$

In other words, the cumulative gradient magnitude at each pixel is equal to the gradient magnitude of the pixel plus the minimum of the cumulative gradient magnitudes of the pixels directly above, for vertical seams, and directly left, for horizontal seams. This procedure allows us to build the vertical cumulative gradient magnitude matrix from top to bottom in $$O(3*m*n)$$ and the horizontal cumulative gradient magnitude matrix from left to right in $$O(3*m*n)$$. The same $$10$$ by $$10$$ image now requires just about $$300$$ operations!

## Results
By repeatedly removing optimal vertical and horizontal seams, we can significantly alter the aspect ratio of an image while still maintaining the structure and form of important image regions. The images below contrast regular and content-aware resizing.

# Project 5: Face Detection
In this assignment, we trained a linear support vector machine on histograms of oriented gradients (HoG) features extracted from face datasets in order to perform face detection. Our approach is based on the work of [Dalal and Triggs](http://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/triggs/pubs/Dalal-cvpr05.pdf).

## Overview

### What is a HoG?

### What is a SVM?

## Training the Linear SVM
Every good machine learning algorithm is built upon good data. We trained our linear classifier on HoG features extracted from faces in the [Caltech Web Faces Project](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/Caltech_10K_WebFaces/) and non-faces in the Wu et. al and [SUN Scene](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/vision/SUN/) datasets using the [VLFeat Library](http://www.vlfeat.org/).

The images below are visualizations of the trained classifier. The image on the left uses a HoG cell size of 6 and the image on the right uses a HoG cell size of 3. Smaller cell sizes provide more descriptive features and increase classifier accuracy, but significantly reduce classifier performance and increase training time.

## Results
The images below show the result of applying the classifier to images of soccer teams. The yellow rectangles  represent actual faces drawn by a human, the green rectangles represent actual faces identified by the classifer (true positives) and the red rectangles represent faces identified by the classifier that are not actually faces (false positives).

The images below show the result of applying the classifier to images of my computer vision class. The image on the left shows the result for regular faces and the image on the right shows the result for occluded faces. Even though people deliberately tried to fool the face detector, my algorithm was still able to detect some of the faces.
