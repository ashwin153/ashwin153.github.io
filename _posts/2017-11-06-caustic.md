# Introduction
---
Caustic is a transactional programming language for building race-free distributed systems. It
allows programmers to write applications as if they were single-threaded, but distribute them
arbitrarily without error.

Suppose there exist two programs $$A$$ and $$B$$ that each increment a shared counter $$C$$. 
Formally, each program reads the current value of $$C$$, $$x$$, and then writes $$C = x + 1$$. If 
$$B$$ reads *after* $$A$$ writes, then $$B$$ reads $$x + 1$$ and writes $$C = x + 2$$. However, if 
$$B$$ reads *before* $$A$$ writes but after $$A$$ reads, then both $$A$$ and $$B$$ will read $$x$$ 
and write $$C = x + 1$$. This is known as a __race condition__, because the value of $$C$$ depends 
on the *order* in which $$A$$ and $$B$$ are executed. Race conditions may seem relatively benign, 
but they can have catastrophic consequences in practical systems. What if your bank determined your 
balance differently depending on the order in which deposits are made?

Programmers have a variety of synchronization mechanisms at their disposal for dealing with race 
conditions. However, usage of these mechanisms is cumbersome and error-prone. Caustic *implicitly*
synchronizes wherever it is required by a program. Because the language takes care of 
synchronization, building distributed systems in Caustic is remarkably simple. Let's look at a few
examples to see just how simple it is in practice.

# Distributed Counter
---
Let's revisit the distributed counter problem from before. Our algorithm is straightforward, but it
is difficult to find simple implementation of a generic, distributed counter. Contrast the 
implementation of a [GCounter][3] in the Akka project with its equivalent in Caustic.

```
module caustic.example

/**
 * A distributed counter.
 */
service Counter {

  /**
   * Increments the total and returns its current value.
   *
   * @param x Reference to total.
   * @return Current value.
   */
  def increment(x: Int&): Int = {
    if (x != null) x += 1 else x = 1
    x
  }

}
```

# Distributed Queue
---
Let's examine a more complicated example. Many distributed systems rely on queues to pass
information between decoupled components. Contrast the implementation of a [DistributedQueue][4] in
the Curator project with its equivalent in Caustic.

```
module caustic.example

/**
 * A distributed message queue.
 */
service Queue {

  /**
   * Adds the message to the end of the queue.
   *
   * @param queue Queue.
   * @param message Message.
   */
  def push(queue: List[String]&, message: String): Unit =
    queue.set(queue.size, message)

  /**
   * Returns the message at the front of the queue.
   *
   * @param queue Queue.
   * @return Head.
   */
  def peek(queue: List[String]&): String =
    queue.get(0)

  /**
   * Removes and returns the message at the front of the queue.
   *
   * @param queue Queue.
   * @return Head.
   */
  def pop(queue: List[String]&): String = {
    var head = peek(queue)
    queue.set(0, null)
    head
  }

  /**
   * Returns the number of messages in the queue.
   *
   * @param queue Queue.
   * @return Length.
   */
  def size(queue: List[String]&): Int =
    queue.size

}
