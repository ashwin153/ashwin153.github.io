<p>Over the past few months, I have spent a lot of time tinkering with genetic algorithms and neural networks. In previous projects, I have used these genetic algorithms and neural networks to solve simple problems (e.g., function minimization, maze solving, pattern recognition, etc.). However, the more I experimented with these primitives of artificial intelligence, the more I wanted to apply them to larger, more complicated problems. An article I read on <a href="http://kotaku.com/you-can-play-pac-man-on-google-maps-right-now-1694756745">Kotaku</a> inspired me to apply my knowledge of artificial intelligence to recreating PacMan.</p>
