<p>Consider a situation in which a thirsty husband is furious that his wife has once again finished all of their milk. When the situation is examined in isolation, the husband’s anger seems irrational. It’s just a carton of milk! When the situation is viewed in the broader scope of their relationship; however, the husband’s anger might seem justified. Maybe he has told her on numerous occasions to replace the empty carton in the refrigerator, or maybe he has a medical condition that requires immediate access to milk. This situation illustrates a larger point: our ability to rationalize our emotions increases as we broaden the scope of our investigation. Therefore, the only way to fully rationalize our emotions is to view them in the broadest possible context: all previous actions taken by every individual. Because this is impossible to do, <strong>we must accept that our emotions will always have some degree of unexplainable irrationality.</strong></p>
