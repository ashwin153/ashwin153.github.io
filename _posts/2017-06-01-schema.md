# Introduction
---
Schema is a Scala DSL for expressing and [optimistically executing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimistic_concurrency_control) database transactions. It is intended to serve as a replacement for SQL, which has reigned as the language of choice for programming database interactions for the past 43 years. As a motivating example, let's write a transaction to atomically increment a counter, ```x```, in MySQL and Schema. In contrast with MySQL, Schema does not require an explicit table definition. Furthermore, the Schema transaction will run on *any* transactional key-value store (including MySQL). Check out the [User Guide](https://github.com/ashwin153/schema/wiki/User-Guide) for more examples of Schema in action.

```sql
CREATE TABLE `counters` (
  `key` varchar(250) NOT NULL,
  `value` BIGINT,
  PRIMARY KEY (`key`)
)

START TRANSACTION;
INSERT INTO `counters` (`key`, `value`) VALUES ("x", 1) 
ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE `value` = `value` + 1
COMMIT;
```

```scala
Schema { implicit ctx =>
  val counter = Select("x")
  If (!counter.exists) {
    counter.value = 1
  } Else {
    counter.value += 1
  }
}
```

# What's Wrong With SQL?
---
## Usability or Scalability
SQL stands for "structured query language" and it is precisely the structure, or [schema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_schema), that SQL provides that have traditionally made the relational databases on which it runs so popular. While schemas provide an intuitive, organizational structure that simplifies data manipulation, they are notoriously difficult to support at scale. Large tech companies are increasingly turning toward "schema-less" key-value stores like [Google's Spanner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanner_(database)), [Facebook's Cassandra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Cassandra), and [Amazon's DynamoDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_DynamoDB). Clearly, developers are now forced to make a conscious tradeoff between the *useability* of a schema and the *scalability* of a NoSQL/NewSQL key-value store. **Why can't we have both?**

Schema provides a dynamically-typed schema over *any* key-value store. Therefore, developers get both the programmability of a schema and the performance of a key-value store.

## Disparate Interfaces
SQL varies wildly from database to database, particularly when writing database transactions. Because most of these "dialects" of SQL are not interoperable, it is extremely challenging to change the underlying database once development is under way. The tremendous expense of rewriting database queries is a significant reason why larger companies are locked into their existing database infrastructure and are unable to modernize them. **Why does the query language depend on the underlying database?**

Schema provides a uniform interface for expressing and executing database transactions. That means that the same transaction will work without modification on, for example, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Cassandra.

## Deficient Functionality
SQL lacks functionality that is common in most modern programming languages. Because SQL has no concept of important constructs like conditional branching, loops, and local variables, it becomes extremely difficult to express programs in SQL that are relatively straightforward in other languages. This has the effect of making SQL extremely difficult to correctly write and easily maintain. **Why can't SQL be as expressive and comprehensible as other programming languages?**

Schema's features include: local variables, loops (While/For/Foreach), conditional branching (If/Else), references, secondary indices, json results, automatic memory management, and transaction rollback. An exhaustive enumeration of supported operations can be found in the [Appendix](https://github.com/ashwin153/schema/wiki/Appendix).

# Future Work
---
Schema is very much a work in progress. Here are some of the ideas that are in the pipeline.

- Python, C++, Java, and Rust bindings.
- Additional database integrations (currently only MySQL and PostgreSQL).
- Distributed, transactional key-value store implementation.
